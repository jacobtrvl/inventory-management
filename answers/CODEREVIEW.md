## Code Review

```
    var users = make(map[string]string)
func createUser(name string) {
users[name] = time.Now().String()
    // Duplicates are not checked.
    // No locks are used: concurrent access to the map can occur
    // since createUser is called from goroutines concurrently
    // and is accessing the global 'users' map.
}
func handleRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
name := r.URL.Query().Get("name")
    // Input validation is missing (e.g., string length).
    // String inputs need to be handled carefully as they can be a security risk.

go createUser(name)
    // Not an ideal use case for a goroutine
    // No error handling: failures in createUser are not managed.

w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    // Immediately returning. (This is not an ideal an use case for immediate return)
    // If the underlying process is time-consuming, returning immediately may improve user experience, but the status code in such cases  (after basic validation) should be http.StatusAccepted (202).

## How would you manage high-concurrency in a Go microservice (thousands of requests per second)?
Go has excellent built-in support for concurrency.

Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime and provide an efficient way of handling concurrent requests. The built-in synchronization primitives (from the sync package and channels) offer a clean way to coordinate concurrent operations.

While the Go runtime can theoretically handle very large numbers of goroutines, performance is still bounded by system resources such as memory, network connections, and database connections.

When the workload is very high, the design should incorporate techniques such as worker pool patterns, connection pooling, and caching. With a well-designed Go microservice and the right system-level considerations, applications can support tens of thousands of requests per second.

Additional considerations include:

- Using an API Gateway to route traffic across microservices or instances (For distributing the load).

- Using Message Queues for handling long running processes

- Leveraging infrastructure-level scaling, such as Kubernetes autoscaling.


## Recommended project structure for large Go services?

```
ProjectRoot/
├── cmd/                # Main.go files for microservices
│   └── service-name/
│       └── main.go
├── internal/           # Core business logic
│   └── api/            # API definitions and handlers
├── pkg/                # Public libraries (exported for other projects)
├── bin/                # Compiled binaries (usually gitignored)
├── config/             # Configuration files and parsing logic
├── deploy/             # Deployment scripts and manifests
├── docs/               # Project documentation
├── test/               # Integration tests
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── Makefile
└── README.md
```


Note: Go does not have an officially recommended project structure. Only the *internal* directory is enforced by the language (visibility restriction). The rest are community conventions. Some projects place all packages at the root directory, but the above structure is one of the most common and cleaner approaches.


## Approach to configuration management in production?
Configurations can be passed to Go programs via environment variables, files, or command-line arguments.
Go provides a clean way to implement these.

Recommended Strategy:

General configurations → Use configuration files. YAML files are best for human-readable configurations.

Environment(Deployment)-specific configurations → Use environment variables. This simplifies deployment and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

Configuration management depends on the infrastructure being used.

In Kubernetes deployment:

- Store non-sensitive configurations in ConfigMaps.
- Store sensitive data such as credentials in Secrets.
- Store environment specific data in deployment manifests

For parsing configurations in Go:

For simple use cases, standard YAML/JSON unmarshaling is sufficient.

For more complex configuration structures, libraries like Viper provide flexibility, environment variable overrides, and hot-reloading.

## Observability strategy (logging, metrics, tracing)?

Logging – Use structured logging (e.g., slog, zerolog). Logs can be collected and processed by systems like Logstash or Datadog for searching and alerting.

Metrics – Instrument with Prometheus or OpenTelemetry standards. Metrics can be scraped by Prometheus or sent to Datadog. Set alerts for important signals such as error rates, latency, and throughput.

Tracing – Use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing. Traces can be visualized with Jaeger or Datadog to understand request flows across services.

It’s important to decide what to instrument, which metrics to expose, and to what level to trace.
Too little instrumentation makes debugging production issues difficult, while too much can affect performance.

## Go API framework of choice (e.g., Gin, Chi) and why?
Standard HTTP library – Straightforward and dependency-free. I would select it for infrastructure projects where the number of APIs to support is minimal.

Gin – A good choice if the project has many APIs and cleaner code organization is important.


For an e-commerce project, I would select Gin. For an infrastructure project, I may go with the standard HTTP library.
